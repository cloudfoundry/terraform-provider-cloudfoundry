# Contributing

We thank you for taking an interest in our project and contributing to it. Contributions can be in the form of raising bugs or fixing them as well. PRs and discussions for new features and improvements are welcome as well. Discussions can be done in the discussion section.

## Engaging in Our Project

We use GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you are a new contributor, see: [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute)

* Before implementing your change, create an issue that describes the problem you would like to solve or the code that should be enhanced. Please note that you are willing to work on that issue.

* The team will review the issue and decide whether it should be implemented as a pull request. In that case, they will assign the issue to you. If the team decides against picking up the issue, the team will post a comment with an explanation.

## Steps to Contribute

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from other contributors on the same issue.

If you have questions about one of the issues, please comment on them, and one of the maintainers will clarify.

## Contributing Code or Documentation

You are welcome to contribute code in order to fix a bug or to implement a new feature that is logged as an issue.

The following rule governs code contributions:

All contributors to this project must have a signed Contributor License Agreement (**"CLA"**) on file with us. The CLA grants us the permissions we need to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project; you or your employer retain the copyright to your contribution. Before a PR can pass all required checks, our CLA action will prompt you to accept the agreement.

Head over to the [Linux Foundation EasyCLA](https://api.easycla.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/v2/repository-provider/github/sign/1797134/394751388/618/#/?version=2).


Note: A signed CLA is required even for minor updates. If you see something trivial that needs to be fixed, but are unable or unwilling to sign a CLA, the maintainers will be happy to make the change on your behalf. If you can
describe the change in a bug report, it would be greatly appreciated.

## Issues and Planning

* We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancement requests.

* Please provide as much context as possible when you open an issue. The information you provide must be comprehensive enough to reproduce that issue for the assignee.
