description: |-
  Provides a resource for creating users in the Cloud Controller database. Supports creating a user via username and origin which can be accomplished by Org Managers provided CAPI property cc.allow_user_creation_by_org_manager is enabled. No explicit calls are made to the UAA endpoints as part of the resource creation.
  Note : An Org manger will not be able to retrieve information of a newly created user until the user is assigned an org-role to any of the orgs that can be accessed by the Org Manager. If the end goal is role assignment, better would be to use the cloudfoundry_org_role or cloudfoundry_space_role to accomplish the same.
