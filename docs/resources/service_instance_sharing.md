# cloudfoundry_service_instance_sharing (Resource)

Provides a resource for managing service instance sharing in Cloud Foundry.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "cloudfoundry_org" "my-org" {
  name = var.org_name
}

data "cloudfoundry_space" "current-space" {
  name = "current-space"
  org  = data.cloudfoundry_org.my-org.id
}

data "cloudfoundry_space" "space-to-share-with" {
  name = var.space_name
  org  = data.cloudfoundry_org.my-org.id
}

data "cloudfoundry_space" "another-space-to-share-with" {
  name = var.space_name
  org  = data.cloudfoundry_org.my-org.id
}

# existing service instance
data "cloudfoundry_service_instance" "svc" {
  name  = var.service_instance_name
  space = data.cloudfoundry_space.current-space.id
}

resource "cloudfoundry_service_instance_sharing" "instance_sharing" {
  service_instance = data.cloudfoundry_service_instance.svc.id
  spaces           = [data.cloudfoundry_space.space-to-share-with.id, data.cloudfoundry_space.another-space-to-share-with.id]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `service_instance` (String) The ID of the service instance to share.
- `spaces` (Set of String) The IDs of the spaces to share the service instance with.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The GUID of the object. This will be the same as the service_instance GUID.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```terraform
# terraform import cloudfoundry_service_instance_sharing.<resource_name> <service_instance_guid>

terraform import cloudfoundry_service_instance_sharing.my_instance_sharing a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-12345678abcd
```

For Terraform 1.5+ users, you can also use the newer import blocks syntax:

```terraform
import {
  to = cloudfoundry_service_instance_sharing.my_instance_sharing
  id = "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-12345678abcd"
}
```
