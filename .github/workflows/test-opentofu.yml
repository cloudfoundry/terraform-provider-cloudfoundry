# The primary focus of this provider is Terraform, however, it is nice to see if there are deviations in the implementations between Terraform and OpenTofu.
# This is a restricted test set for OpenTofu
# The full test is defined in the test.yml workflow.
# This file is intended to focus testing the OpenTofu compatibility against the latest provider version.
# This is a manually triggered test.
