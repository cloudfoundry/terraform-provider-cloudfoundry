# Terraform Provider for Cloud Foundry

![Golang](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.23-informational)

## About This Project

The Terraform provider for [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) allows the management of resources via [Terraform](https://terraform.io/).

This provider makes use of the [go-cfclient](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-cfclient) to interact with the Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller [v3 APIs](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/3.159.0/index.html) and take advantages of the same. Additionally, the [v2 APIs are deprecated](https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/16.22.0/).

You can find usage examples in the [examples folder](examples/) of this repository.

Check the [Authentication](/Authentication.md) documentation for supported approaches.

## Developing & Contributing to the Provider

The [developer documentation](DEVELOPER.md) file is a basic outline on how to build and develop the provider. 

For more information about how to contribute, the project structure, and additional contribution information, see our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Prerequisites and Usage of the Provider

For the best experience using the Terraform Provider for Cloud Foundry, we recommend applying the common best practices for Terraform adoption as described in the [Hashicorp documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/well-architected-framework/operational-excellence/operational-excellence-terraform-maturity). For migrating usage from the existing [cloudfoundry-community](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/terraform-provider-cloudfoundry) provider to this provider, refer to our [migration-guide](./migration-guide/Readme.md).
