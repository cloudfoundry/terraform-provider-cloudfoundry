| Attribute name | Cloud Foundry Provider|  Community Cloud Foundry Provider (old) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| org_name| 🔵 | 🔴 | Organization name where space is present has to be specified. |
| space_name | 🔵 | 🔴 | Instead of specifying guid for `space` attribute in the old community provider, user should specify space name in `space_name` attribute for the new provider. |
| space | 🔴 | 🔵 | Refer above |
| buildpack | 🔴 | 🟢 | `buildpack` attribute functionality can be achieved by `buildpacks` attribute. |
| enable_ssh | 🔴 | 🟢 | It can be enabled on a space level. For further details, refer [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html#config-ssh-access-apps). |
| stopped | 🔴 | 🟢 | `stopped` attribute functionality can be achieved by setting `instances` to 0. |
| routes.route | 🟢 | 🟢 | In the new provider, FQDN needs to be specified instead of the route GUID in the community provider. Route resource is automatically created if not present. |
| routes.port | 🔴 | 🟢 | Not present in V3 manifest schema. Can be set in `port` attribute of  [`cloudfoundry_route`]( /docs/resources/route.md) resource. |
| routes.protocol | 🟢 | 🔴 | - |
| health_check_interval | 🟢 | 🔴 | - |
| log_rate_limit_per_second | 🟢 | 🔴 | - |

| readiness_health_check_type | 🟢 | 🔴 | - |
| health_check_timeout | 🔴 | 🟢 | `health_check_timeout` has been changed to `timeout`  to maintain conformity with V3 API. |
| timeout | 🟢 | 🟢 | `timeout` attribute in the current provider is for health check timeout and not for starting the app initially. |
| service_binding | 🔴 | 🟢 | - |
| service_bindings | 🟢 | 🔴 | `service_binding` has been changed to `service_bindings` to maintain conformity with V3 API. |
